    "TITLE": "About me",
    "DESCRIPTION": "Once I realized that programming was my true calling, I never looked back. In 2022, I embarked on a journey with Edgemony, which enabled me to deepen my foundational knowledge of web development, with a particular focus on frontend technologies. Through Bcame, I gained exposure to new frameworks and also delved into backend languages, working on both e-commerce platforms and other projects. Currently, at OTO s.r.l., I am advancing my expertise in Angular and Typescript."
